        	<p>Whenever people hear the word sustainability, mostly likely they will think of environment related things like green energy production, recycling, sustainable farming or other stuff like that, they are only a small part of sustainability. Sustainability is the way we can protect our natural environment, protect human and ecological health all while not compromising, but improving human way of life. Think of sustainability as the sustainability of human life. The way people achieve or go about achieve these is called Sustainable Development. This website aims to provide detailed information into all areas of sustainable development, written in a way that someone with no prior knowledge of the topic can understand and, maybe even, enjoy. </p>
